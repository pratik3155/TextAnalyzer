<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">In today's age of global connectivity, the ability to effectively manage text in various forms has become increasingly important. Users often require tools that can handle text manipulation, translation, and summarization seamlessly. However, creating software that can integrate these diverse functionalities while ensuring scalability and performance can be a daunting task. Text manipulation refers to the process of transforming text to achieve a specific goal such as converting text to a specific format. Translation is the process of converting text from one language to another, while summarization involves no of characters and words in given input text. To ensure that these tools are effective, they must be designed to handle large volumes of text and be capable of scaling up as the volume of text grows. Additionally, they must be performant, ensuring that operations are carried out quickly and accurately. Creating such tools requires significant expertise in software development. However, the benefits of having such tools are immense, as they can enable individuals and businesses to more effectively communicate and manage information.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">
The TextAnalyzer Website is a sophisticated platform that offers a range of text management tools to help users perform various text manipulations easily. This website is built using Node.js, a powerful and scalable backend technology, that ensures high performance and reliability. The website's front end is hosted on Azure Static Web Apps, which provides a user-friendly interface for easy navigation. The website stores user search history on Azure Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database service, which guarantees fast and secure access to user data.

The website's suite of text management tools is extensive, including features like text summarization, case conversion and more. Users can use these tools to manipulate their text in various ways, such as converting text into lower case or upper case. The website's intuitive interface ensures that users can access these tools effortlessly and complete their tasks quickly.

In summary, the TextAnalyzer Website is a comprehensive platform that provides users with a powerful set of text management tools, a robust and scalable backend, a user-friendly front end, and secure storage of user data. It is an ideal tool for anyone looking to manage their text quickly and efficiently.</p>
